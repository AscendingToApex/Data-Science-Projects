# Colorado Big Game Hunting Data Driven Draw

## Project Understanding
### Background:
Imagine waiting 20 years to hunt a specific animal; only to get an e-mail showing that you didn't obtain the tag because you didn't look through over 6,000 pages of pdf documents. This situation happens more than you think for Colorado big game hunter.

For big game hunting, Colorado uses a preference point system to increase the chances of getting the opportunity to hunt specific units over time. The hunters with the higher preference points have a higher probability of obtaining tags that require a draw than hunters with the fewer preference points. The preference points are specific to species and hunters are able to accumulate a single point per species after unsuccuessfully drawing a tag. In addition, the majority of "trophy" units have a limited number of tags available per hunt code, which is specific to species, region in colorado, time of year, and hunting method.

### Objective:
1. Provide a tool for Colorado big game hunters to quickly visualize the probability of drawing a specific tag based on how many preference points that applicant has for the target species.
2. Explore the "Point Creep" phenominon, which occurs when the number of tags available doesn't meet the demand of applicants and each year the quantity of points it takes to draw the tag increases. 

### Current Situation:
There's currently resources available for an annual fee in order to evaluate high level oppotunites for drawing specific tags, but the resources lack granularity and implementaion of data science methodologies for predictions and does not showcase usage of inference to prove point creep is occuring
