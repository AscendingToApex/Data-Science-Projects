# Objective:
### Describe
- Standard Report: What is happening?
- AD HOC Report: How many, how often, where?
### Explore
- Query Drilldown: Where exactly is the problem?
- Visualization: What does the problem space look like?
- Clustering: What patterns or groupings can be found in my data
### Explain
- Correlation: What is related to my problem?
- Inference: What can a sample tell me about the population?
- Casual: What conclusions can I draw about cause?
### Predict:
- Simulation: How likely is each outcome?
- Forecasting: What is the current trend?
- Predictive Modeling: What will happen in each instance?
### Prescriptive:
- Alerts/Scores: Which predictions prompt action?
- Optimization: How can we achieve the best outcome?
- Optimization Under Uncertainty: How can we achieve the best outcome addressing uncertainty and variability?

### Data Mining Goals
1. Classification: Classify the data items into predefined classes.
2. Association: Associate one attribute to another.
3. Sequence: The pattern functions analyze the records and delete frequency occurring patterns such as in retailer database.
4. Regression: Map data items into real values prediction variables.
5. Clustering: Identify a finite set of clusters to describe the data.
6. Summarization: Finding a description for a subset of data.
7. Dependency Modeling: Finding a model which describes significant dependencies between variables.

Keep in mind Tom Khabaza's Nine Laws of Data Mining
1. Business objectives are the origin of every data mining solution.
2. Business knowledge is central to every step of the data mining process.
3. Data preparation is more than half of every data mining process.
4. The right model for a given application can only be discovered by experiment (aka “There is No Free Lunch for the Data Miner” NFL-DM).
5. There are always patterns (aka “Watkin’s Law).
6. Data mining amplifies perception in the business domain.
7. Prediction increases information locally by generalization.
8. The value of data mining results is not determined by the accuracy or stability of predictive models. (Rather, their value is found in more effective action and improved business strategy.)
9. All patterns are subject to change. (Thus, data mining is not a once-and-done kind of undertaking.)

# Data Understanding
### Plan for Project Phase
### Tools Used
### Number of data sources:
- List all data sources here
- [Source Name](Source website)

### Collecting inital Data
- [Data Collection Code](Github website where the code for inital data collection is located)

### Describe Data
Describe data here

### Explore Date
- How many rows and columns
- Number of variables and data types
- Categorize values as one of the following:
    - Categorical: Have a set number of values
    - Continuous: Have an infiite number of values
    - Descrete: Have a set number of values that are numeric

### Verify Data Quality
- Find any missing values

# Data Preparation
### Plan for Project Phase
### Tools Used
The data preparation process includes selecting, cleaning, constructing, integrating, and formatting the data. Please see below for a link to the code that completed the previously mentioned processes.
- [Data Preparation Code](Github website where the code for data preparation is located)

# Exploratory Data Analysis
### Plan for Project Phase
### Tools Used
### Objective to be answered
- Variable identification: define each variable and its role in the dataset 
- Univariate analysis: for continuous variables, build box plots or - histograms for each variable independently; for categorical variables, build bar charts to show the frequencies
- Bi-variable analysis - determine the interaction between variables by building visualization tools
- Continuous and Continuous: scatter plots
- Categorical and Categorical: stacked column chart
-Categorical and Continuous: boxplots combined with swarmplots
- Detect and treat missing values
- Detect and treat outliers
